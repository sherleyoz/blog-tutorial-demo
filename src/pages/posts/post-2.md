- It seems that the Palamu was left in possession of the Chero ruler Bhagwat Rai, but the Mughal troops continued to be stationed there.
- Raja Anant Rai (1605-1612)

- The Cheros of Palamu took advantage of the confusion created by the death of Akbar. They reasserted their independence and drove out the Mughal army from Palamu.

- Raja Sahbal Rai (1612-1627)

- Sahbal Rai as the Chero ruler succeeded him. Sabhal Rai proved to be very powerful rule of Palamu. He also started creating problems for the Mughals.
- This forced Jahangir to order Mughal campaign against Sabhal Rai who was defeated and was captured. He was taken as a prisoner to Delhi.

- Raja Pratap Rai (1627 - )

- Palamu was given out as a jagir to the Governor of Patna in 1632 A.D. in return for annual payment of one lac thirty-six thousand. The Governor of Bihar tried to squeeze more money from Pratap because of the high annual payment fixed for his new Jagir (Palamu). Pratap Rai found the difficult to meet the rising demand of the Mughals and consequently withheld the payment of customary tribute.

- 1642 - The Mughal army led by **Shayista Khan** , Governor of Bihar, entered Aru on January 26, 1642 and proceeded towards the Palamu fort. The Mughal army surrounded Palamu fort. As a result, Pratap Rai offered to compromise and surrendered. Shayista Khan accepted the proposal and after receiving the Peshkash of Rupees eighty thousand, he returned to Patna of Feb 12, 1642.
- Shayista Khan was transferred to Allahabad and was replaced by **Itqab Khan**. Pratap Rai again became defiant, and he also failed to pay tribute to the Mughals. He started giving shelter to the opponents of the Mughals.

- Two of his uncles, Dariya Rai and Tez Rai allied with Itiqab Khan. Both of them imprisoned Pratap Rai with the help of Itiqab. Tez Rai became the ruler of Palamu but he refused to hand over Pratap Rai to the Mughals on various excuses.
- **Dariya Rai** , the elder brother of Tez Rai became dissatisfied with his younger brother. He **conspired with Itiqab Khan**. Accordingly, Itiqab Khan sent Zabardast Khan to attack the Palamu fort. The Cheros suffered many setbacks. Tez Rai left the Palamu fort with a hunting party.

- During his absence, **Surat Singh** and **Sahbal Singh** , the sons of **Madan Singh Thakuria** , came out openly in favour of Pratap Rai. They released Pratap Rai and put the Palamu fort in his possession. Tez Rai hid himself in the forest of Palamu.

- Pratap Rai realized the futility of fighting with Mughals. He proposed to accept the sovereignty of Mughals. Zabardast Khan replied to this proposal by asking him to go to Patna. But Pratap Rai was not willing to go there. He wanted a guarantee of his safety and security.
- 1643 - At last, Zabardast Khan departed from Palamu accompanied by Pratap Rai on November 19, 1643.

- With its spoils, be **built one of the Palamau forts** (the lower fort) near modern Satbarwa.

- Medini Rai took full advantage of the prevailing ascension war in the Mughal camp and reverted to the traditional policy of hostility. Aurangzeb did not like this. He ordered Daud Khan, the governor of Bihar to invade Palamu.

- Medini Rai offered Daud Khan a tribute and requested him to return to Patna. But Daud Khan rejected his proposal and proceeded towards the Chero capital.

- Medini Rai promised unconditional surrender and proposed to pay to Daud Khan one lac. rupees as Peshkash. But Daud Khan could not do much because the Emperor Aurangzeb had ordered that the Chero ruler should embrace Islam, pay the Peshkash and retain the position of Palamu.
- Before Medini could send a reply, Tahawwur Khan (one of the Mughal commanders) launched an attack from the right on the left flank of the Cheros. Ultimately battle between the Chero and the Mughals took place.
- The Cheros became panicky and abandoned the Palamu fort. Medini Rai took shelter in the neighboring Surguja.

- Daud Khan handed over Palamu to Mankali Khan who was appointed as Faujdar by the Mughal Emperor. But Mankali remained as Faujdar at Palamu till 1666. Afterwards he was transferred and Palamu was put under the charge of the Governor of Bihar.
- This provided Medini Rai with an opportunity to regain his lost territory. He took position of Palamu and ruled it till 1674 A.D.

- Around 14th century Ghatwar king rebelled against Nagvanshi kings. King of Tamar attacked Khukhragarh the capital of Nagvanshis.
- The Raja deputed two brothers by name Baghdeo and Singhdeo to restore order. Baghdeo suppressed rebellion, killed the king of Tamar and his son.

The country was saved by its rocky boundaries and sterile soil from conquest by the Marathas.
- The Palamu estate was granted to Ghanshyam Singh of Deo as a reward to his help to the British in suppressing the Cheros and the Kharwars.
