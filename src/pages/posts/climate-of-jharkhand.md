* Factors affecting climate in Jharkhand
  o	Latitudinal position
  o	Height from sea level
  o	Distance from sea
  o	Western disturbances
* Tropic of Cancer passes almost through the centre of state which makes the climate sub-tropical, but the location of state on height along with monsoonal wind makes the climate monsoonal.
  o	Monsoon wind comes here from the Arabian Sea and other from the Bay of Bengal.
  o	The wind from the Bay of Bengal brings more moisture than Arabian sea due to its proximity to Bay of Bengal. 

* About one-third of the area has an average elevation of 400m and rest has the height of 300 m. The average annual temperature of Jharkhand is 25 °C and average annual rainfall is 1200 mm.
