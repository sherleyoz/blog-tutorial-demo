# HISTORY of JHARKHAND

![Jhiri Lake](../images/Jhiri-Lake.jpg)

# Prehistoric era

- Stone tools and Microliths have been discovered from Chota Nagpur Plateau region which are from Mesolithic and Neolithic period.
  - There are **ancient Cave Paintings in Isko, Hazaribagh district** which are from Meso-chalcolithic period (9,000–5,000 BC).
  - There is a **group of megaliths found close to Barkagaon** that is about 25 km from **Hazaribagh** at Punkri Barwadih, which has been proven to date back to beyond 3000 BCE.
- There are several Cooper tools found in Chota Nagpur Plateau which are from 2nd millennium BCE. These Copper finds known as Copper Hoard Culture.
  - In **Kabra-Kala mound at the confluence of Son and North Koel river in Palamu district** various antiquities and art objects have found which are from Neolithic to Medieval period and the pot-sherds of Redware, black and red ware, black ware, black slipped ware and NBP ware are from Chalcolithic to late medieval period.

# Iron age (c. 1800 – c. 200 BCE)

- **Barudih in the Singhbhum district** of Jharkhand, **yielded evidence of microliths** , Neolithic celts, iron slags, wheel made pottery, and iron objects include a sickle. The earliest radio carbon dating give a range of 1401–837 BCE for this site.
- Around c. 1200–1000 BCE, Vedic Aryans spread eastward to the fertile western Ganges Plain and adopted iron tools which allowed for clearing of forest and the adoption of a more settled, agricultural way of life. During this time, the central Ganges Plain was dominated by a related but non-Vedic Indo-Aryan culture.
- The end of the Vedic period witnessed the rise of cities and large states (called mahajanapadas) as well as sramaṇa movements (including Jainism and Buddhism) which challenged the Vedic orthodoxy. According to Bronkhorst, the Sramana culture arose in "greater Magadha," which was Indo-European, but not Vedic. In this culture, Kshatriyas were placed higher than Brahmins, and it rejected Vedic authority and rituals. In those days the Jharkhand state was a part of Magadha and Anga.
- In Mauryan period, this region was ruled by a number of states, which were collectively known as the **Atavika (forest) states**. These states accepted the suzerainty of the Maurya Empire during Ashoka's reign.

# Classical to medieval periods (c. 200 BCE – c. 1200 CE)

- Samudragupta, while marching through the present-day Chota Nagpur region, directed the first attack against the kingdom of Dakshina Kosala in the Mahanadi valley.
- In the 7th century, Chinese traveler **Xuanzang** passed through the region. He **described the kingdom as Karnasuvarna and Shashanka as its ruler**. To the north of the kingdom was Magadha, Champa was in East, Mahendra in the west and Orissa in the south. The region was also part of Pala Empire.

# Ancient dynasties of Jharkhand

_ **Munda Kingdom** _

- In Chhotanagpur the credit for establishing a state goes to **Risa Munda** who was the first tribal leader of the Mundas.
  - He selected **Sutna Pahan** as the ruler of the Mundas and named the new state as " **Sutia Nag Khand**".
  - Sutna Pahan had divided his state into 07 garhs:-

- 1. Lohagarh (present Lohardaga).
- 2. Hazaribagh
- 3. Palungarh (present Palamu)
- 4. Mangarh (present Manbhum)
- 5. Singgarh (present Singbhum)
- 6. Kesalgarh
- 7. Surmug garh (present Surguja).

- These seven garhs were further sub-divided into 21 parganas namely

- Omdanda, Doisa, Khukhra, Surguja, Jaspur, Gangpur, Porhat, Girga, Birua, Lachra, Birna, Sonpur, Belkhadr, Belsing, Tamar, Lohardih, Kharsing, Udaipur, Bonai, Korya, Changmangkar.

- This administration division reveals that the state established by Sutna Pahan extended beyond the present area of Jharkhand. Unfortunately, the rule of Sutana Pahan could not last long and his state disintegrated into small parts.

_ **Man Dynasty** _

_ **Rakshel Dynasty** _

- Palamu was ruled by the Rakshels. The Rakshels had reached Palamu by moving through Rohtasgarh from the Rajputana area of Rajasthan.
- The old fort of Palamu was built by the King of Raksel Rajput Dynasty.
- The Mughals, during the reign of Emperor Akbar, under the command of **Raja Man Singh, invaded in 1574** , but subsequently **his contingent at Palamu was defeated in 1605** following the death of Akbar. During the reign of Jahangir, the Subedar of Patna and Palamu tried to impose a tribute on the Raksel rulers which they refused to pay. This resulted in three attacks in series by the Mughals.
- The rulers of Raksel Rajput Dynasty in 1613 AD were invaded by the Chero under **Bhagwant Rai,** with the aid of Rajput chiefs, the ancestors of The Thakurais of Ranka and Chainpur. When the Raksel **Raja Man Singh** then ruling Palamu was out of capital **Bhagwant Rai** seized power. On hearing this news Raja Man Singh made no efforts to regain his kingdom of Palamu, retreated into Surguja (in Chhattisgarh) and established the Raksel Rajput Dynasty of Surguja.

_ **Singh Dynasty of Singhbhum** _

- The Singh dynasty was the ruling clan of Singhbhum area.
- The Singhbhum dynasty claimed that their rule was established before the arrival of the Hos in Singhbhum but the Hos tribes refute these claims by saying that Singhbhum was named after their god "Singbonga".
- Founders of Singh dynasty had come from western India and occupied Singhbhum around the 8th century A.D.
- There are two branches of Singh dynasty.
- The **founder of the first branch** was **Kasi Nath Singh** but not much is known about this first branch.
- The **founder of the second branch** was **Darp Narayan Singh** who succeeded to the throne in 1205 A.D. Yudhishthir succeeded him after his death and ruled from 1262 to 1271 A.D. He was succeeded by Kasi Ram Singh. The 13th ruler of the second branch was Jagannath Singh II. He was very cruel and autocratic. His tyrant behaviour caused the revolt of the Bhuiyans.

_ **Nagbanshi Dynasty of Chhota Nagpur** _

- Chhotanagpur was ruled by the Nagbanshi ruler
- Ancestors of the present Maharaja of Chhotanagpur established themselves as the Chiefs of the Munda tribes probably in the 10th century of the Christian era.
- **Phani Mukut Rai** was the first Nagbanshi ruler. Areas like Banta, Hajam, Badam, Ramgarh, Gola, Tori, Palani, Mankeri, Barwa and Keonjhar were included in his state.
- **Panchet** was situated to the east of Chhotanagpur and **Keonjhar** was located to the south of the Nagbanshi state. The Nagbanshi ruler took the help of the Panchet ruler and defeated the ruler of Keonjhar.
- The fourth Nagbanshi ruler **Raja Pratap Rai** transferred his capital from **Suteambe** (present day Ranchi) **to Chutia** (also Ranchi).
- One of the Nagbanshi rulers **Bhimkaran** had to fight against the ruler of Surguja because the latter had invaded Chhotanagpur with a very big army. But Bhimkaran changed his capital from **Chutia to Khukhra** (in bero block of Ranchi district). He wanted to protect the capital from the Muslims invasions because Chhotanagpur fell on way to Bengal and the Turkish rulers always tormented the Nagbanshi territories.

- The 13th century proved eventful for Jharkhand. Bakhtiyar Khilji attacked Nadiya after passing through Jharkhand.
- The upheavals in South Bihar during the reign of Iltutmish and Balban did not have much impact on Jharkhand because the Nagbanshi ruler Harikaran was very powerful.
- The military commander of **Mohammed bin Tughluq** , **Malik Baya** reached up to Chai-Champa.
- Later **Firoz Tughluq** invaded Hazaribagh and captured many areas. Firoj Tughluq later consolidated his position and made Satgaon the capital.
- All these facts prove that the Delhi Sultans could not advance beyond Satgaon (near Koderma) in pre-Mughal period.
- One of the reasons behind this was the resistance given by the Nagbanshi rulers.
- The above facts lead us to conclusion that most of the areas of Jharkhand remained independent in the ancient period and pre-Mughal period. The invasions on Hazaribagh, Singhbhum and other parts of Chhotanagpur did not have any significant impact. The rulers of Chhotanagpur had succeeded in checkmating the foreign intruders and maintaining an independent status.
- It has already been seen that different rulers were ruling the different areas of Jharkhand in the pre-Mughal period. Palamu was in the control of the Rakshels, the Chhotanagpur was under the occupation of the Nagbanshi and the Singhbhum area was under the rule of the Singh dynasty.
- The small rulers of Jharkhand continued to maintain their independence status without any external interference. The Muslim Army always entered Jharkhand in pursuit of enemies or in course of their invasion of Bengal.

# Medieval History

# Sher Shah Suri

- In the medieval period the first ruler, who interfered in Jharkhand, was Sher Shah.

_Against Chero rulers of Palamu_

- Sher Shah sent his military chief Khawas Khan against **Maharath Chero**. The military campaign ended in the surrender of Maharath Chero.

- It is said that the white elephant named Shyam Sundar was produced before Sher Shah as the spoil of the war. Even after the defeat Maharath Chero did not stop the Chero battle for supremacy.

- The Nagbanshi rulers remained isolated from the foreign invasions. The Muslims inroads into Jharkhand, which took place prior to 1585 A.D., were mainly either chastising expedition or occasional passage of troops on their way to various military expeditions. The area of Jharkhand remained largely undisturbed.
- The attention of the Mughals particularly that of Akbar and Jahangir was drawn toward Jharkhand because of the existence of the diamonds in rivers. However, Akbar was guided more by strategic and political considerations and not by the mere possibility of securing a few diamonds.

# Akbar

- In Akbarnama the region of Chota Nagpur is described as Jharkhand ( **Jangal Pradesh** ).
- Jharkhand had been the shelter of Sher Shah during his conflict with Humayun. Some of Afghan opponents like Junaid, Haji and Gaji brothers and Bayezid had been using this area for their operations against the Mughal. **Junaid Kararani** tried to enter Bihar through Jharkhand in **1575**. He was countered by the imperial troops and compelled to retire to the hilly area of Rampur.

_Conflict with Nagbanshi Kingdom_

  - **1585 A.D.** - The immediate reason of Mughal invasion on the Nagbanshi kingdom had been the lack of respect to the Mughal emperor. Nagbanshi ruler thought that the Mughals could not cross the mountain very easily. In the 30th year of Akbar reign, **Shahbaz Khan Kamboh** dispatched a force against the **42**** nd **** Nagbanshi ruler, Madhu Singh / Madhukarn Sahi**. The Mughal army over ran the country and plundered it wealth. The Mughals obtained a rich booty. The Kokra ruler became a tributary under the Mughal government. A sum of rupees six thousand was fixed as its annual revenues payable to the Mughals.
    - The defeat of the Kokra ruler strengthened the position of Ramgarh ruler who assumed independent status in 1592.
    - Madhukaran Sahi or Madhu Singh participated in the Mughal expedition against Qutlagh Khan of Orissa. He served in the detachment of Yusuf Chak Kashmiri and had played an admirable role in the fight against the Afghans of Orissa.
  - Thus, towards the close of 16th century the existing isolation of Kokra appears to have ended, the areas had been brought under Mughal suzerainty and an annual tribute had been fixed.

_Conflict with Cheros_

  - The Mughals could not make much headway against the **Cheros of Palamu**. In the year **1589 A.D. Man Singh assumed the charge of Governorship of the province of Bihar**.
  - Man Singh marched against Cheros. The ruler at that time was **Bhagwat Rai**. The Cheros made an abortive attempt to block the passage but Man Singh forced his way killing hundreds of soldiers and took many Cheros fighters as prisoners. He returned to Patna along with huge booty.
  - Nothing is known about subsequent history of Cheros till Akbar 's death in 1605 A.D. It seems that the Palamu was left in possession of the Chero ruler Bhagwat Rai but the Mughal troops continued to be stationed there.

#

# Jahangir

_Conflict with Nagbanshi Kingdom_

  - **Durjan Sal**** succeeded Madhukarn Sahi **. It seems that immediately after his accession to throne, the Nagbanshi ruler** threw off all his allegiance to the Mughal** and withheld the customary tribute.
  - Naturally the independent postures of Durjan Sal coupled with the possibility of **acquiring diamonds from Kokra** induced Jahangir to order an expedition against the Nagbanshi ruler.
    - He ordered **Zafar Khan** to invade Chhotanagpur and occupy the diamond mines of the area. But Zafar suddenly left for Bengal without completing the assignment of Chhotanagpur.
  - The Mughal emperor Jahangir became displeased and replaced him with Ibrahim Khan. **Ibrahim Khan** also proceeded to complete the expedition against the Nagbanshi ruler. He invaded Durjan Sal 's territories and finally Durjan Sal was defeated and arrested. Chhotanagpur (Kokra) was placed under the Mughal Empire. After his capture, Durjan Sal offered ransom to Ibrahim Khan in the form of jewels, gold. But the latter did not release him and took him as captive to Patna. From Patna, **Durjan Sal was sent to the Gwalior fort as a prisoner**. According to the Nagbanshi tradition, Durjan Sal 's confinement lasted **for 12 years**.
  - **Durjan sal was released from prison due to his expertise of diamonds**. He was asked to verify the genuineness of two diamonds, which he did very successfully. The emperor was so much pleased that he not only ordered the release of Durjan Sal but also restored the property taken from him. He also succeeded in getting the release of neighboring rulers who were confined in the prison with him.
  - Meanwhile Durjan Sal 's absence from Kokra had resulted in the capture of Nagbanshi throne by one of his relatives. Durjan sal was compelled to fight for regaining his lost position. Fortunately, he was helped by some of rulers who accompanied him from the Gwalior prison. In this feud Durjan became victorious but the internal strife of the Nagbanshi family compelled some of the members to migrate to distant places.
  - **Durjan Sal**  **transferred his capital from Kokra to Doisa**  **because of strategic consideration**. The selection of Doisa (also called Navratangarh, in Sisai block, Gumla dist.) was made because it was surrounded on three sides by lofty hillocks and on the fourth side by the river South Koel. Durjan Sal constructed a beautiful place called **Navratangarh**. Originally the palace was five-storied structure. But at present it exists in a dilapidated condition.

_Conflict with Cheros_

- The Cheros of Palamu took advantage of the confusion created by the death of Akbar. They reasserted their independence and drove out the Mughal army from Palamu.
- Meanwhile **Anant Rai** had **succeeded Bhagwat Rai**. In the second year of Jahangir reign, Afzal Khan was appointed the Governor of Bihar. Iradat Khan was appointed as a Diwan in 1607. Jahangir ordered an expedition against Anant Rai but it failed because of the sudden death of Afzal Khan. ~~Anant Rai ruled for 31 years from 1630 to 1661 but this is not supported by the details given by Mohammedan historians.~~
- **Sabhal Rai** as the Chero ruler succeeded him. Sabhal Rai proved to be very powerful rule of Palamu. His rule extended up to Chauparan. He also started creating problems for the Mughals. This forced Jahangir to order Mughal campaign against Sabhal Rai who was defeated and was captured. He was taken as a prisoner to Delhi. All these facts reveal that the Mughal-Chero relations remained strained during Jahangir reign.
- After the death of Sahbal Rai, Pratap Rai became the Chero ruler of Palamu.

# SHAH JAHAN

  - _Conflict with Cheros_

- Pratap Rai was contemporary of Shan Jahan. He was a powerful chief, but the middle of reign was plagued by large scale Mughal invasions. As a result the relations between the Mughal and the Chero of Palamu continued to be hostile even during the early year of Pratap Rai 's reign. Palamu was given out as a jagir to the Governor of Patna in 1632 A.D. in return for annual payment of one lac thirty-six thousand. The Governor of Bihar tried to squeeze more money from Pratap because of the high annual payment fixed for his new Jagir (Palamu). Pratap Rai found the difficult to meet the rising demand of the Mughals and consequently withheld the payment of customary tribute. Abdula Khan, who was the Governor of Bihar at that time, could not pay attention towards Palamu because of his other preoccupations. This made Pratap Rai more arrogant.
- Meanwhile Shayista Khan became the Governor of Bihar. When he reported the matter to the emperor, Shah Jahan ordered him to attack Pratap Rai. Shayista Khan marched from Patna on October 12, 1641. It appears that the Mughal governor approached Palamu through Manatu Ghat and captured the same after wars. The Mughal army entered Aru on January 26, 1642 and proceeded towards the Palamu fort. Shyista reached Baoli Cherwan. The Mughal army surrounded Palamu fort. As a result, Pratap Rai offered to compromise and surrendered. Shayista Khan accepted the proposal and after receiving the Peshkash of Rupees eighty thousand, he returned to Patna of Feb 12, 1642.
- Meanwhile Shayista Khan was transferred to Allahabad and was replaced by Itqab Khan. In the meantime, Pratap Rai again became defiant and he also failed to pay tribute to the Mughals. He started giving shelter to the opponents of the Mughals. Pratap Rai also lost the affection of the people and offended his chiefs. Two of his uncles, Dariya Rai and Tez Rai allied with Itiqab Khan. Both of them imprisoned Pratap Rai with the help of Itiqab. Tez Rai became the ruler of Palamu but he refused to hand over Pratap Rai to the Mughals on various excuses.
- Dariya Rai, the elder brother of Tez Rai became dissatisfied with his younger brother. He conspired with Itiqad Khan. Accordingly, Itiqab Khan sent Zabardast Khan to attack the Palamu fort. Tez Rai dispatched a force under Madan Singh Thakuri. The Cheros suffered many setbacks. Tez Rai left the Palamu fort with a hunting party. During his absence Surat Singh and Sahbal Singh, the sons of Madan Singh Thakuria, came out openly in favour of Pratap Rai. They released Pratap Rai and put the Palamu fort in his possession. Tez Rai hid himself in the forest of Palamu.
- In the second phase, Pratap Rai realized the futility of fighting with Mughals. He proposed to accept the sovereignty of Mughals. Zabardast Khan replied to this proposal by asking him to go to Patna. But Pratap Rai was not willing to go there. He wanted a guarantee of his safety and security. At last, Zabardast Khan departed from Palamu accompanied by Pratap Rai on November 19, 1643. Pratap Rai presented an elephant and agreed to pay a tribute of Rupees one lac to the Mughal emperor. Shan Jahan gave him the rank of a Mansabadar of one thousand and Palamu was given to him at a rental of one kror of dams. Pratap Rai remained loyal to the Mughal up to the year 1647. Nothing is known about his activities after this.
- Pratap Rai 's successor was Bhupal Rai who ruled only for few months. Later Medini Rai became the ruler and continued for a longer period. He took full advantage of the confusion in the Mughal fort towards the end of Shan Jahan 's reign. Medini Rai paid attention on the welfare of Palamu.

# AURANGZEB

_Conflict with Nagbanshi Kingdom_

- During the reign of Aurangzeb, the ruler of Kokra (Chhotanagpur) was Raghunath Shah.

- Raghunath was highly religious and charitable. He constructed a number of temples such as one in Doisa and Jagannath temple in Ranchi.
- He also built the Madan Mohan temple in Borea village in Kanke. It was completed in 1682 A.D. at a total cost of Rs. 14001. The temple also has an inscription containing several information.
- In 1685 Raghunath constructed a temple of Ram and Sita at Chutia in Ranchi town.
- Raghunath 's reign was marred by the invasion of Medini Rai, the Chero ruler of Palamu. He ransacked Doisa and carried away a huge booty. The plunder included a big gate, which Medini Rai installed in the new Palamu fort. The gate is still known as the Nagpuri Gate. Raghunath 's reign came to an end in about 1690 A.D.

- His successor was Ram Shah who ruled for 25 years. It appears that Ram Shah maintained friendly relations with Mughals, particularly Aurangzeb. At this time certain portions of Kokra were included in Orissa. The revenue of this portion was paid to Aurangzeb through the Mughal revenue officers of Orissa. In 1692 A.D., Ram Shah paid to the Mughal total revenue worth Rs. 9705.

- But Ram Shah had followed aggressive policy towards Singhbhum. He invaded Singhbhum and destroyed Jayantgarh. Later both the rulers entered into conciliation and established matrimonial relations. Two of the sisters of Ram Shah were married to Jagannath Singh. It was at this period that Singhbhum was renamed Porhat. Ram Shah also attacked Palamu. But the detailed results are not known.

  - _Conflict with Cheros_

- Medini Rai had taken full advantage of the prevailing confusion in the Mughal camp and reverted to the traditional policy of hostility. Aurangzeb did not like this. He ordered Daud Khan, the governor of Bihar to invade Palamu. The emperor also ordered the Jagirdar of Bihar to assist Daud Khan. Daud Khan took position of Kothi without any opposition in 1660 A.D. On June 3, 1660, Daud Khan also captured the Kunda fort and razed it to the ground. Surwar Rai murdered the chief of Kunda, Chun Rai.
- In the meantime, Medini Rai, the Chero ruler of Palamu, offered Daud Khan a tribute and requested him to return to Patna. But Daud Khan rejected his proposal and proceeded towards the Chero capital.

- Medini Rai promised unconditional surrender and proposed to pay to Daud Khan one lac. rupees as Peshkash. But Daud Khan could not do much because the Emperor Aurangzeb had sent him in different direction.
- Aurangzeb had ordered that the Chero ruler should embrace Islam, pay the Peshkash and retain the position of Palamu. This imperial order was conveyed to Medini Rai.
- But before Medini could send a reply, Tahawwur Khan (one of the Mughal commanders) launched an attack from the right on the left flank of the Cheros. Ultimately battle between the Chero and the Mughals took place.
- The Cheros became panicky and abandoned the Palamu fort. The ruler of Palamu took shelter in the neighboring Surguja. Daud Khan handed over Palamu to Mankali Khan who was appointed as Faujdar by the Mughal Emperor. But Mankali remained as Faujdar at Palamu till 1666.
- Afterwards he was transferred and Palamu was put under the charge of the Governor of Bihar. This provided Medini Rai with an opportunity to regain his lost territory. He took position of Palamu and ruled it till 1674 A.D. The reign of Medini Rai is regarded as golden period because he made sincere efforts to promote agriculture and make Palamu prosperous.

- Medini Rai's rule ended in 1674 and Rudra Rai who ruled from 1674 to 1680 A.D succeeded him. After Rudra Rai, Drik Pal ascended on the throne and ruled up to 1697 A.D. Drik Pal's successor was Shabal Rai who ruled up to 1716 A.D.

_Conflict with Nagbanshi Kingdom_

- Ram Shah 's successor was Yadhunath Shah who ruled from 1715 A.D. to 1724 A.D. He was powerful ruler who took full advantage of the prevailing chaos and withheld the customary tribute to the Mughal Government. Yadhunath Shah had to face the invasion of the Palamu ruler Ranjit Rai.
- Meanwhile Yadhunath Shah had stopped the payment of tribute. As a result, Surbuland Khan, who was the Mughal Governor of Bihar, launched a campaign against the Nagbanshi ruler. The latter offered to pay Rupees One Lac as Nazrana. The proposal was accepted by Surbuland Khan. Yadhunath Shah paid the agreed amount and after this Surbuland went back to Patna.
- The attack of Surbuland proved to be an eye opener for the Nagbanshi ruler. The Nagbanshis felt that Doisa was not safe from the foreign invaders. Consequently Yadhunath Shah decided to transfer his capital from Doisa to Palkot. The new place was more distant from the frontiers of Bihar and therefore considered more secure than Doisa. But even the choice of Palkot proved wrong. After a few decades the Marathas began their inroads in Palkot.
